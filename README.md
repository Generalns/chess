## Chess Game
This is a chess game project with java. I know it has lots of features missing such as castling, en passant, multiplayer, computer opponent (ai maybe). The code structure is also improvable and most probably there are lots of bad practices and possibly some bugs. But the goal of the project was to code a chess game and understand and apply chess logic in java which is an object oriented language.
